# How to run Zato in a Docker container:

# Firstly, get Zato's Dockerfile:

wget http://example.com/Dockerfile

# Secondly, you have to build Docker image:

sudo docker build -t $USER:zato /path/to/Zato/Dockerfile

# Now you have to retrieve your web admin password:

sudo docker run $USER:zato /bin/bash -c 'cat /opt/zato/web_admin_password'

# The password will be printed to terminal. It is also permanently stored
# within Zato's docker image, and you can access it at
# /opt/zato/web_admin_password

# Next step is to create a container in which Zato components will be launched:

sudo docker run -t -i -p 6379:6379 -p 8183:8183 -p 17010:17010 -p 17011:17011 \
                      -p 11223:11223 $USER:zato

# This command will start Zato in a new container, and you will see
# detailed logging output in your terminal: those are Supervisord,
# Redis and Zato components.

# If you don't want to see the logs, add -d flag to the run command:

sudo docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8183:8183 -p 17010:17010 -p 17011:17011 \
                   -p 11223:11223 $USER/zato-2.0.0pre1

# If you later change your mind, use 'attach' command 
# to attach running Docker container to your terminal:

sudo docker attach [container_id]

# To check what's the container's id, use:

sudo docker ps
